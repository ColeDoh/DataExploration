title: Drug Overdose Deaths in Connecticut From 2012 to 2018
---
## Written by Cole Doherty

## Introduction
This data explores the amount of drug overdose deaths for each top drug in Connecticut. The data explores many different categories including age, city, and sex to see if there is a correlation between each. The data shows that the top three drugs in the state of Connecticut are Fentanyl, Cocaine, and Heroin. There is a deep correlation between these top three drugs and the age, sex, race and city you live in. White middle aged men who live in the most populous cities in Connecticut (Hartford, Bridgeport, and New Haven) have the highest drug overdose deaths in Connecticut compared to any other demographic. My data directly compares sex, age, and race through the use of bar, line and pie charts to support my discoveries. Interestingly, but also expected the data shows a stark age difference between drug overdose deaths. Heroin seems to be a younger drug with 85 deaths at age 29, compared to Cocaine deaths being a much more appealing drug for older people. There were only 38 Cocaine deaths at age 29.

## Dataset 

This data shows the amount of overdose deaths for Connecticut residents from 2012 to 2018. This includes drugs like heroin, fentanyl, and cocaine. The data is also broken up into many different sub categories including sex, race, age, and loacation of the death(city and county). This dataset was found on kaggle which is a free to use website where users can publish and explore data sets. The data set was published by a women named Ruchi Bhatia, a data scientist at OpenMind. She is a Kaggle grandmaster meaning she is well respected and reliable. She produced this data "to examine trends in polysubstance detection associated with drug-related overdose deaths".

Specifically I am interested in this data because I have had friends who have had drug problems in the past. I am interested to find out the specific driving forces for which demographic abuses these drugs the most. Even though this is only for the state of Connecticut, I am interested in finding out the current trends for each specific drug. I specifically want to learn more about which drug is the most dangerous amonst all the others. This will be a great oppurtunity to share this information with friends, family, and others who might be dealing with a drug problem. 

Here is the [Kaggle Data](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/drug-overdose-deaths) I used.

## Initial Questions

I initially had a very difficult time picking out a dataset. I had no idea what I wanted to do and none of the datasets that were given drew any interest to me. I searched and searched through Kaggle until I stumbled upon this datset. There were a lot of different categories that I knew I could draw from. Sex, age, race, city were all very interesting to compare drug deaths to. I knew that with these subcategories I could draw detailed questions and make well thought out conclusions about the data. I was really curious to see how these different demographics played a role in the amount drug deaths there are. 

I was very curious to see the answers these three questions...Between each of the drugs which has the highest amount of deaths? Do females or males have a higher death rate? Which race has the highest amount of drug overdose deaths? These are all questions I came up with before I started working with the data. As I was making all of the graphs, I was very curious to compare the top three drugs to one another. First I was curious to see if there was a trend for the amount of deaths in each year for the top three drugs. Between Fentanyl, Heroin, and Cocaine which drug is trending downwards towards less deaths or upwards towards more deaths. As I gathered data for Heroin and Fentanyl deaths in each Connecticut city I was curious to see the location for which these deaths occured. I later created a pie chart that shows the amount of Heroin deaths in each corresponding location (Convalescent home, hospital, residence, other). This data was only for the city of Hartford because it was the top city for Heroin drug deaths in Connecticut.

I was very surprised to see that Fentanyl deaths were on a consistent rise through the years 2012 to 2018 while Cocaine and Heroin were trending downward. Another thing that surprised me was the age in which these deaths occured most. I was expecting there to be a lot of deaths for people in their 20s because I tend to believe thats who abuses these drugs the most but I was completely wrong. Middle age people in the 30 to 50 year old range were the highest. Astonishingly Cocaine had the most amount of deaths for older people peaking at 50 years old. When I think of this drug I think of young high schoolers, and college students possibly overdosing the most, not middle aged people who are much wiser and smarter. 

Overall the data was very easy to use. There was no need to wrangle the data at all. The issue was most definitely finding an interesting enough data set with a lot of sub categories to compare to one another.
