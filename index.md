# Drug Overdose Deaths in Connecticut from 2012-2018
### Cole Doherty

## Introduction
This data explores the amount of drug overdose deaths for each top drug in Connecticut. The data explores many different categories including age, city, and sex to see if there is a correlation between each. The data shows that the top three drugs in the state of Connecticut are Fentanyl, Cocaine, and Heroin. There is a deep correlation between these top three drugs and the age, sex, race and city you live in. White middle aged men who live in the most populous cities in Connecticut (Hartford, Bridgeport, and New Haven) have the highest drug overdose deaths in Connecticut compared to any other demographic. My data directly compares sex, age, and race through the use of bar, line and pie charts to support my discoveries. Interestingly, but also expected the data shows a stark age difference between drug overdose deaths. Heroin seems to be a younger drug with 85 deaths at age 29, compared to Cocaine deaths being a much more appealing drug for older people. There were only 38 Cocaine deaths at age 29.

## Dataset 

This data shows the amount of overdose deaths for Connecticut residents from 2012 to 2018. This includes drugs like heroin, fentanyl, and cocaine. The data is also broken up into many different sub categories including sex, race, age, and loacation of the death(city and county). This dataset was found on kaggle which is a free to use website where users can publish and explore data sets. The data set was published by a women named Ruchi Bhatia, a data scientist at OpenMind. She is a Kaggle grandmaster meaning she is well respected and reliable. She produced this data "to examine trends in polysubstance detection associated with drug-related overdose deaths".

Specifically I am interested in this data because I have had friends who have had drug problems in the past. I am interested to find out the specific driving forces for which demographic abuses these drugs the most. Even though this is only for the state of Connecticut, I am interested in finding out the current trends for each specific drug. I specifically want to learn more about which drug is the most dangerous amonst all the others. This will be a great oppurtunity to share this information with friends, family, and others who might be dealing with a drug problem. 

Here is the [Kaggle Data](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/drug-overdose-deaths) I used.
